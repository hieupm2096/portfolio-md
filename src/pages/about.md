Hello there, I am Hieu ðŸ‘‹, a 5 YoE Vietnamese developer currently focusing on building mobile application using **[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)** - a cross-platform UI framework. I'm deeply passionate about creating beautiful application, not only in appearance but also in its clean, testable and maintainable architecture.

As _**a Flutter software engineer**_, my development stack often includes:
[Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/) for _dependency injection_, _state management_, easily _fetching and caching data_ with minimal boilerplate code.
[dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) and [retrofit](https://pub.dev/packages/retrofit) for _networking_
[GoRouter](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) for _navigation_
And some libraries to deal with APIs' responses, linting and other aspects of the app.

For medium and large project, my preferred architecture is **Clean Architecture** with feature-first focused, inspired by [ResoCoder](https://resocoder.com/2019/08/27/flutter-tdd-clean-architecture-course-1-explanation-project-structure) and [CodeWithAndrea](https://codewithandrea.com/articles/flutter-app-architecture-riverpod-introduction).
This architecture helps me to ensure a good _separation of concerns_ between UI code (Presentation layer), business logic (Domain layer) and data (Data layer).
To make it better, feature-first structure arranges code based on features, allowing easier maintenance and scalability as the app grows. See how I apply this architecture in real-world projects in my _Work_ section.
In conclusion, to make a robust project structure, I aim at testability, maintainability, scalability and this architecture aligns perfectly with that goal.

If you read all the way through down there, truly appreciate, I put a lot of effort into it ðŸ˜Š. Feel free to explore more and contact me if you need, thank you so much.
